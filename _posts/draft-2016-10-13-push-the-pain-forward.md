# Push the Pain Forward

A developer friend of mine (who as a developer, prefers the company of code over that of people)
once told me "There are two types of people in the world.  I don't like either of them."  When it comes to
the SDLC, there are two types of pain, I like neither of them:

* Pain from things that are bad
* Pain from things I'm bad at

The first is solved by performing an action less frequently.  Conversely the second is solved
by performing and action *more* frequently.
